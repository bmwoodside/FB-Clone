# FB-Clone

Work-in-progress - tons of refactoring happening at the moment...
facebook clone, eventually!

Re-designing the back-end -> switching out from MongoDB to MySQL - having to re-architect everything :(

Feel free to follow-along as I continue to learn more new things! (After the refactor, next up will be Sockets.io for live messaging!!) - the project board and issues tracker should both be public, and are being updated constantly as I work on everything.
